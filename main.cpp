/**
 * PURPOSE:
 * This assignment will help you get practice with:  
 * 1. Abstract Data Types 
 * 2. Inheritance 
 * 3. Polymorphism 
 * 4. C++ pointers 
 * 5. C++ Classes 
 * 6. C++ virtual and pure virtual functions 
 * 7. C++ Class Templates 
 * 8. C++ Arrays 
 *
 * TASK:
 * A container class is a data type that is capable of holding a collection of items and provides 
 * functions to access them. Bag is an example of a container class. It is an unordered collection of 
 * items that may have duplicates.  
 * In this assignment, you are asked to design and develop an abstract Bag class, called 
 * BagInterface, with the following fixed collection of operations: 
 * 1. Insert an item of any type into a bag 
 * 2. Query the bag contents: two queries 
 *  o Is an item in the bag? 
 *  o How many copies of an item is in the bag? 
 * 3. Remove an item from the bag 
 * 4. Clear the bag 
 * 5. Get the size of the bag  
 *  o How many items are there in the bag? 
 * 6. Check if the bag is empty 
 * 7. Check if the bag is full 
 *  o Assume the bag capacity is 20 
 *
 * In addition to BagInterface, you are asked to implement two classes of bag
 * implementations: PlainBag and MagicChangeBag. PlainBag is a simple container that
 * holds items of any type using an array implementation. MagicChangeBag is also very similar
 * to PlainBag, with two exceptions. When an item is inserted into a magic change bag, itâ€™ll
 * magically disappear, and bag looks empty. Whenever a remove operation is invoked, all the
 * items, except the one is removed will appear.  
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTES:
 * 1. You are not allowed to modify main.cpp implementation. Please use it as it is.
